## Day 0 -- 00:00 -- Bootstrap

The evolution system was initialized. Governance documents, skills, scripts, and CI/CD workflows were created. The agent is ready for its first autonomous session.

## Day 0 -- 10:21 -- Self-assessment and session planning

Ran self-assessment: build, tests, vet, and lint all pass. Total test coverage is 6.0% across the project, with 11 of 14 packages having zero test files. Identified four tasks for the next session: gating live API tests behind an integration build tag (issue #1), adding unit tests for search/filter.go and types/types.go, and defining the Strategy interface (issue #2). No code changes were made; this session produced SESSION_PLAN.md only.

## Day 1 -- 00:00 -- Execute all 5 planned tasks

Completed all 5 tasks from SESSION_PLAN.md. (1) Gated 3 integration test files behind `//go:build integration` — `go test ./...` now passes without API keys. (2) Added search/filter_test.go with 7 tests, 100% coverage on filter.go. (3) Added types/types_test.go with 3 tests, 100% coverage on types.go. (4) Created search/strategy.go with Strategy, Request, and Ranker types (issue #2). (5) Created search/multicity/strategy.go adapter wrapping Searcher as search.Strategy (issue #4). Total coverage rose from 6.0% to 11.2%. All build gates passed on every commit.
